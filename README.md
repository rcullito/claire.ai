## Goal


This will be some type of AI chat bot.


## Guidelines

~ create fault tolerant UX to handle inaccuracies versus improving the model beyond 80% accuracy

~ get data via crowd sourcing or something clever
  - make sure there is a way for clients to correct errors which get fed back into the system to make it better

~ narrow the domain, then keep narrowing. help with word sense disambiguation


## Biz Plan

  ~ market as a support page that can help with common questions. free to use. veterinarians, whomever can always review and correct answers
